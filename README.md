# Academic and Startup Whitepapers

## Overview  
Two versions of a whitepaper which describes the concept, methodology, utility, and philosophy behind a graph-based AI agent. Both versions follow a similar structure but speak to different audiences.

## Audience
This repo contains **two whitepapers**:  
- **Academic Version** – situates the Oracle within computation, biology, philosophy, and symbolic reasoning.  
- **Startup Version** – frames the Oracle as a proof-of-concept for future human–AI collaboration, creativity, and engagement-first design.  

## Why I wrote this: 
To practice two distinct writing modes: one academic-style, fully cited whitepaper, and one startup-style strategic pitch. Both tackle the same technical project from different angles.

## What it demonstrates: 
- Adapting technical content to multiple audiences and tones.  
- Synthesizing research into structured, well-cited analysis.  
- Positioning emerging tech within industry or conceptual contexts.

## 🧪 Case Study Snapshot  

| Case | Prompt | Output | Takeaway |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Genesis Query** | “What does it mean to build a new AI?” | The Spark of Life, The Serpent, The Mirror, The Final Quiet | Birth, reflection, and endings—knowledge framed as myth |
| **Refusal in the Heat** | Professional crossroads in summer | “Too hot. The swamp sleeps now.” | Refusal as communication—machines need not obey |
| **Dinner Riddle** | “What should I eat for dinner?” | The Cauldron, The Trickster, The Echo | Mundane query reframed as ritual, play, and haunting memory |
